This might be just another trivia question but how do you pronounce SQL properly? Nobody knows, but it can be easily come up in a random discussion within the SQL database community.

Two of the most popular pronunciations are `S-Q-L` [ ˈɛs kjuː ˈɛl ] and `sequel` [ ˈsiːkwəl ]. 

According to Wikipedia, SQL was originally called "sequel" but due to a legal challenge, the name was changed to SQL. 


> SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Ted Codd in the early 1970s. This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM’s original quasi-relational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.
> Chamberlin and Boyce’s first attempt of a relational database language was Square, but it was difficult to use due to subscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on SEQUEL.[15] The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because “SEQUEL” was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley aircraft company.


It's interesting that Oracle sides with SEQUEL on this:

> Dr. E. F. Codd published the paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", in June 1970 in the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) journal, Communications of the ACM. Codd's model is now accepted as the definitive model for relational database management systems (RDBMS). The language, Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL) was developed by IBM Corporation, Inc., to use Codd's model. SEQUEL later became SQL (still pronounced "sequel"). In 1979, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle) introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL. Today, SQL is accepted as the standard RDBMS language.

But from MySQL official docs:

> The official way to pronounce “MySQL” is “My Ess Que Ell” (not “my sequel”), but we do not mind if you pronounce it as “my sequel” or in some other localized way.

And even on Oxford Dictionaries, it’s pronounced as S-Q-L.

So to answer the question of which one is correct, I guess we can't because there is none. It's just the matter of which one is more widely used, and which one you are more comfortable using

By the way, which one do you use every day?
